1. Multi-level cache hierarchy configuration.
2. benchmarking.
3. performance optimization.
4. thread state maintanence.
5. bpred refactoring, simple variant first, like in SMTSIM.
6. add on-chip interconnect simulation.
7. add cycle-accurate DRAM controller simulation.
8. add mshr-like pending accesses tracking, like in Multi2Sim.
